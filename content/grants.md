### Building Connected Technical Networks: A Framework for Digital Communities (£9,990.25)

PI: **Liam Berrisford**, Co-I: Cat Russon, Hugh Gifford, Eilis Hannon

Digital Research Technical Professionals (dRTPs) at universities often work in isolation with limited visibility and few leadership opportunities. This project will pilot a model to connect and strengthen these communities. We will begin by mapping the university’s dRTP landscape and building on the existing Research Coding Community, which already spans multiple faculties and professional services.

A central focus of the Hub is in-person community building. Cat and Hugh’s successful Coding Clubs show a strong appetite for face-to-face learning and collaboration. Building on this, our Digital Thursdays will provide a regular anchor for the community, offering a welcoming space for shared learning, conversation, and informal networking that fosters trust and belonging.

These sessions will also highlight emerging community leaders, giving them structured opportunities to develop facilitation, coordination, and communication skills recognised within the university’s professional development frameworks.

From this core hub, we aim to support existing groups and enable new initiatives to form where gaps are identified. Members will be encouraged to start Special Interest clubs, supported by openly available resources such as “Club-in-a-Box” templates, facilitation guides, and a shared events calendar.

Finally, a co-design workshop with dRTPs will help finalise the framework for sustaining communication and leadership across the community.

### Recognising and Rewarding Training Activity in digital Research Technical Professional (dRTP) Roles and Departments (£10,066.62)

PI: Samantha Ahern (UCL) Co-I: **Liam Berrisford (University of Exeter) **, Aleksadra Nenadic (University of Manchester)

Many DRTPs undertake training and, in some cases, formal teaching as part of their roles. However, many do not receive formal preparation for these activities, nor have clear pathways to develop as educators. In addition, there is often limited recognition and reward for training and teaching contributions within DRTP teams, which may hinder professional development if these activities are not valued equally alongside core technical responsibilities. 

UCL’s Centre for Advanced Research Computing has developed an educator development pathway, which this project aims to build upon. The initial phase will work with those who deliver, develop, and support training infrastructure across the UK DRTP landscape to expand existing examples and development opportunities so that they better meet sector needs.

The second phase will work with DRTP leaders to raise awareness of the pathway and advocate for its adoption within their departments. The aim is to promote parity of esteem between technical and training activities in terms of recognition and reward, particularly within promotions processes.This work will raise the profile of training and its importance within the UK research landscape,while also developing a meaningful development pathway including leadership opportunities for those who engage in these activities.

### Andragogy-Aligned LLMs (c. £13,500 notional infrastructure value)

PI: **Liam Berrisford**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in educational contexts, yet access to larger models remains limited for individual researchers due to hardware constraints. This project explores, in a holistic and exploratory manner, how the qualitative characteristics of LLM outputs differ between small, locally deployable models and substantially larger models that require high-performance computing resources.

Using Isambard-AI, the project will experiment with LLMs that are out of scope for laptop-class hardware, focusing on differences in explanatory depth, adaptability to learner context, instructional style, and alignment with adult learning (andragogy) principles. The aim is not formal evaluation or benchmarking, but rather to generate foundational insights that inform the design of future, larger-scale research projects and grant applications in andragogy-focused AI.
